# Michael Hu's User Page

## About
**`Hello world!`** My name is Michael Hu and I am a third-year Math-CS student at UCSD.

I was born and raised in Minnesota but I have since fallen in love with San Diego. I remember looking at a map of California after committing to UCSD and realizing
> Wow, San Diego is *really* close to Mexico

Unsurprisingly, we didn't have a lot of good Mexican food in Minnesota.

While I've spent quite some time at UCSD already, some of the remaining items of my UCSD bucket list include:
- [ ] ***Study abroad***
- [ ] Visit Tijuana
- [ ] <sub>~~Break into the tunnels~~</sub>
- [ ] Visit Seaworld
- [ ] Explore the regional national parks

In my free time I like to play the saxophone, read books, and take landscape photos. I also love listening to house music and finding new food spots around SD.
